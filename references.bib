              Aim 
              Ecological data collected by the general public are valuable for addressing a wide range of ecological research and conservation planning, and there has been a rapid increase in the scope and volume of data available. However, data from eBird or other large‐scale projects with volunteer observers typically present several challenges that can impede robust ecological inferences. These challenges include spatial bias, variation in effort and species reporting bias. 
             
             
              Innovation 
              We use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a community science or citizen science (CS) project. We estimate two widely used metrics of species distributions: encounter rate and occupancy probability. For each metric, we critically assess the impact of data processing steps that either degrade or refine the data used in the analyses. CS data density varies widely across the globe, so we also test whether differences in model performance are robust to sample size. 
             
             
              Main conclusions 
              Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from CS data; however, the degree of improvement varied with species and data density. The largest gains we observed in model performance were achieved with 1) the use of complete checklists (where observers report all the species they detect and identify, allowing non‐detections to be inferred) and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Occupancy models were more robust to a lack of complete checklists. Improvements in model performance with data refinement were more evident with larger sample sizes. In general, we found that the value of each refinement varied by situation and we encourage researchers to assess the benefits in other scenarios. These approaches will enable researchers to more effectively harness the vast ecological knowledge that exists within CS data for conservation and basic research.},

	abstract = {Credibly estimating social-ecological relationships requires data with broad coverage and fine geographic resolutions that are not typically available from standard ecological surveys. Open and unstructured data from crowdsourced platforms offer an opportunity for collecting large quantities of user-submitted ecological data. However, the representativeness of the areas sampled by these data portals is not well known. We investigate how data availability in eBird, one of the largest and most popular crowdsourced science platforms, correlates with race and income of census tracts in two cities: Boston, MA and Phoenix, AZ. We find that checklist submissions vary greatly across census tracts, with similar patterns within both metropolitan regions. In particular, census tracts with high income and high proportions of white residents are most likely to be represented in the data in both cities, which indicates selection bias in eBird coverage. Our results illustrate the non-representativeness of eBird data, and they also raise deeper questions about the validity of statistical inferences regarding disparities that can be drawn from such datasets. We discuss these challenges and illustrate how sample selection problems in unstructured or semi-structured crowdsourced data can lead to spurious conclusions regarding the relationships between race, income, and access to urban bird biodiversity. While crowdsourced data are indispensable and complementary to more traditional approaches for collecting ecological data, we conclude that unstructured or semi-structured data may not be well-suited for all lines of inquiry, particularly those requiring consistent data coverage, and should thus be handled with appropriate care.},

	abstract = {New technologies are rapidly changing the way we collect, archive, analyze, and share scientific data. For example, over the next several years it is estimated that more than one billion autonomous sensors will be deployed over large spatial and temporal scales, and will gather vast quantities of data. Networks of human observers play a major role in gathering scientific data, and whether in astronomy, meteorology, or observations of nature, they continue to contribute significantly. In this paper we present an innovative use of the Internet and information technologies that better enhances the opportunity for citizens to contribute their observations to science and the conservation of bird populations. eBird is building a web-enabled community of bird watchers who collect, manage, and store their observations in a globally accessible unified database. Through its development as a tool that addresses the needs of the birding community, eBird sustains and grows participation. Birders, scientists, and conservationists are using eBird data worldwide to better understand avian biological patterns and the environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence them. Developing and shaping this network over time, eBird has created a near real-time avian data resource producing millions of observations per year.},

	abstract = {The widespread availability of satellite tracking devices has made it possible to track individual migratory birds throughout the full annual cycle, examining how distribution and habitat use change between seasons and regions while also describing the characteristics of migratory movements. We used these devices to examine the full annual cycle ecology of American Woodcock (Scolopax minor; hereinafter woodcock), an early successional habitat specialist whose populations are declining throughout their range in eastern North America. We used these data to develop a multi-season distribution model for woodcock management in Pennsylvania, demonstrating the importance of considering habitat use across multiple seasons for migratory bird conservation. We also used woodcock migratory movements to demonstrate improved methods for classifying animal locations into migratory states, allowing inferences into migratory behavior despite sparse and incomplete data. We examined changes in woodcock habitat selection among seasons, finding that woodcock likely undergo a functional response in their habitat selection to changes in habitat availability throughout the full annual cycle. Finally, we described woodcock flight altitudes and their corresponding vulnerability to various airspace obstacles, finding that low altitude flights are likely a contributing factor to woodcocks’ disproportionate collisions with buildings. Stabilizing woodcock populations will likely require better understanding of woodcock ecology throughout the full annual cycle, as well as the threats they face at each stage. We hope that our comprehensive analysis of woodcock distribution, habitat use, and migration ecology throughout the full annual cycle will improve conservation of this iconic upland bird species.},
