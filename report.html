<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>American woodcock (<em>Scolopax minor</em>; hereinafter woodcock) is
one of the most common species of shorebirds in eastern North America
<span class="citation">(McAuley, Keppie, and Whiting Jr. 2020)</span>,
and it is an early successional habitat specialist whose populations are
declining throughout their range <span class="citation">(Berigan
2024)</span>. Due to its distinct ecological niche of being one of the
only shorebird species in North America that reside in habitats not
adjacent to water during migration, the land mass of potential suitable
habitats for this species is far greater than other water-dependent
birds in Order Charadriiformes such as dunlin (<em>Calidris alpina</em>)
or semipalmated plover (<em>Charadrius semipalmatus</em>). As a result,
woodcocks are more easily stumbled upon in close proximity to human
activities: during woodland hikes, county road drives, morning park
jogs, or nighttime camps.</p>
<p>Along with its significance of being an umbrella species - a
representative of an ecosystem specifically for conservation purposes
that protects other species within its ecosystem - the woodcock is also
one of the highly sought-after shorebird species among naturalists and
birders due to its appearance, behavior, and relatively difficulty of
detection. In addition, its ‘dance’ moves has made it into an internet
favorite when paired with a wide array of music on social media <span
class="citation">(Farley 2022)</span>. Thus, it has become a curious
inquiry to members of science community, policy makers, and the general
public for the ecological, temporal, and spatial factors that may affect
the chances one could encounter a woodcock in the wild.</p>
<p>For this project, we demonstrated the observational data in various
ways in response to scientific questions on detection of woodcocks,
along with creating a prediction model using variables both included in
the observational data and inferred using latitude and longitude
information. Our charts showed the power of citizen science data and the
multitude of analyses that the data enables researchers and scientists
to explore and answer new questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Data &amp; Methods</h2>
<div id="ebird-data" class="section level3">
<h3>2.1 eBird data</h3>
<p>eBird (ebird.org) is an online citizen science platform for bird
observations developed by Cornell Lab of Ornithology <span
class="citation">(Sullivan et al. 2009)</span>. Users can submit
observations in the form of a birding checklist, which records the time,
distance, duration, location, species observed, and species counts for
each birding outing. With over 35,000 checklists submitted daily, eBird
has congregated a sizeable amount of data capable of allowing
comprehensive data analysis in various field within or adjacent to
ornithology.</p>
<p>The observational and sampling data in the form of individual
checklists on the platform, eBird Basic Dataset (EBD), is publicly
available and is downloaded after submitting a request to download the
data of woodcocks. Due to the large file size and limited CPU powers,
the dataset is limited to observations from January 2019 to January 2024
in New York State.</p>
<p>eBird data is then processed using the <code>auk</code> package <span
class="citation">(Strimas-Mackey, Miller, and Hochachka 2023)</span> for
data visualization and processing. The .txt files were loaded into R,
and the shared checklists were collapsed to eliminate replicated
observations. The non-complete checklists were then filtered to ensure
data cleaniness. The zero-filling method is then used to infer
non-detections using the sampling data. Some of the variables were
transformed for modeling: time is converted to a decimal value, and a
variable for speed is created. Checklists too long or too fast were
eliminated.</p>
</div>
<div id="environmental-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>2.2 Environmental variables</h3>
<p>The overall goal of this process is to access the weather information
and land cover data at the places where observations occur, as these are
hypothetical factors that may influence the distribution of woodcocks,
and will be used in our model. We use weather data from National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (see details at <a
href="https://www.noaa.gov/">https://www.noaa.gov/</a>), an use land
cover data from <a href="https://www.mrlc.gov/">Multi-Resolution Land
Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium</a>.</p>
<p>Two data sets were used for weather data for the analysis:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/">Yearly
weather records data</a>: The daily weather records from each weather
station, including <code>tmax</code> (max temperature in degree
Celsius), <code>tmin</code> (min temperature in degree Celsius),
<code>prcp</code> (precipitation), <code>snow</code> (snow in mm),
<code>snwd</code> (snow depth in mm)) from 2019-2024; Though may other
kinds of weather information are included, we don’t consider them in our
model.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt">Station
location data</a>: A data set match the station ids with locations
(latitude, longitude)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, the weather data are recorded by weather stations, which are
not necessarily at the same place with bird observations. Therefore, we
assign the nearest weather station within 50 km to the places of
observation. To realize the goal. We first merge the weather records
from each weather station from 2019-2024 with the data set indicating
the location of each weather station by station id. Then we added the
weather records from the nearest weather station to the bird observation
data set by date and location (i.e. latitude &amp; longitude).</p>
<p>For land cover data, we use a .tif file. To integrate the land cover
data from the GeoTIFF raster file into the observation CSV file, the
observation data set was first converted into an sf spatial object using
its longitude and latitude columns. Next, the coordinate reference
system (CRS) of the sf object was aligned with the CRS of the raster
file to ensure compatibility. Then, land cover values were extracted
from the raster based on the observation coordinates. Finally, these
extracted land cover values were added as a new column to the original
data set, which was then saved as a CSV file for further analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-pre-processing-and-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>2.3 Data pre-processing and modeling</h3>
<p>This analysis used eBird data with environmental variables to
calculate the observation ratio (<code>obs_ratio</code>) for modeling.
Average temperature (<code>t_avg</code>) and snowfall
(<code>snow</code>) were grouped into intervals (1°C and 5 units,
respectively), with flag variables created for each range. Observations
within the same flag were counted and normalized by the total
observations, providing the proportion of American Woodcock sightings
under specific conditions.</p>
<p>After grouping and flagging the data, a linear model was used to fit
the data, with environmental variables as the predictors and obs_ratio
as the target variable.</p>
</div>
<div id="predictatory-data-simulation" class="section level3">
<h3>2.4 Predictatory data simulation</h3>
<p>For continuous variables such as <code>tmax</code>,
<code>tmin</code>, <code>snow</code>, and <code>snwd</code>, we fitted
their distributions based on the original data and generated simulated
prediction data within the 95% confidence interval. Realistic
constraints were also incorporated, such as ensuring <code>tmax</code>
is always greater than <code>tmin</code>, southern regions having higher
temperatures than northern regions, and snowfall being lower in southern
areas compared to the north.</p>
<p>Within each generated grid, 1,000 data points were simulated, with
their latitude and longitude constrained to lie within the respective
grid boundaries. Using the previously trained regression model, we
predicted the observation ratio (<code>obs_ratio</code>) for each point
and summed these values to obtain the total observation probability for
each grid. Additionally, realistic landcover data were assigned to each
grid based on its geographic location, further enhancing the accuracy
and realism of the simulated data to align with actual conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-optimization" class="section level3">
<h3>2.5 Model optimization</h3>
<p>After constructing the full linear model, it was observed that the
model contained an excessive number of predictors, which could lead to
potential overfitting. To address this issue and optimize the final
model, three regularization methods—LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net—were
employed to perform predictor selection.</p>
<p>Upon identifying the optimized models recommended by each of the
three methods and comparing the weights assigned to all retained
predictors, we found that the predictor <em>landcover</em>, while
initially deemed significant in the summary results of the full linear
model, was assigned near-zero weights across all three optimization
methods. This indicates that <em>landcover</em> contributes minimally to
the model. Therefore, to maintain model simplicity, it is recommended to
exclude this predictor.</p>
</div>
<div id="griding-and-heating-map-ploting" class="section level3">
<h3>2.6 Griding and heating map ploting</h3>
<p>We applied grid operations to the map of New York State, dividing it
into grids to more precisely identify bird observation locations and
simulate real-world conditions. After multiple adjustments, a grid size
of 0.1 was selected as the optimal scale. The final observation
probabilities of the American woodcock are displayed in the form of a
heatmap.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Results</h2>
<p>Preliminary exploratory analysis were carried out to answer some
common questions related to woodcock detection within New York State. By
creating a <code>season</code> factor and creating a bar chart showing
the number of checklists per season, we visualized the total amount and
the difference in number of observations of woodcocks each season. The
observation counts were also categorized by time of day to see if there
is any significant pattern in time of the day for detection. Then, a
chi-squared test is run to test whether the differences between season
and day times are significant. Also, the number of observations is also
summarized by county.</p>
<p>We also explored observer behavior to understand how the timing and
duration of observation efforts influence woodcock detection. We checked
the times when observations started and made a plot showing how they are
spread out during the day. We also grouped the observation lengths into
half-hour intervals and made another plot to see how long observers
spend observing. To see how effort distance and time spent observing are
connected, we created a scatter plot, and used different colors
representing different times of the day.</p>
<p>We were able to observe a significant difference in number of
observations in various variables. The season of spring and the evening
are where most observations of woodcocks took place. We also observed
that Tompkins county has the highest number of observations, although
that is mostly attributed to the high number of eBird users and
birders.</p>
<p>We optimized our multi-predictor prediction model using LASSO
regression, Ridge regression, and elastic net. Eventually, our model
uses temperature and snowfall as the predictors. Further analysis can be
found on the <a href="modeling.html">modeling page</a> of the project
website. Eventually, a heatmap of predicted observation ratios in NY
state is generated using the optimized model.</p>

</div>
<div id="conclusion-and-discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>4. Conclusion and Discussion</h2>
<p>Overall, we harnessed the power of citizen science data to both
answer various questions on sightings of a rather secrete question and
create a comprehensive prediction model using various temporal and
spatial factors for the abundance in any given place in New York state.
We used a charismatic species that is well-known in naturalist and
birder community as well as anyone using social media as an example to
display our methods in exploring such citizen science data; the same
visualizations and analyses that we demonstrated can be easily
duplicated for other species and observations, or even non-wildlife data
such as occurrence of a disease or the tracking of all crimes in a
city.</p>
<p>The observational and sampling data from eBird allows for computing
absence of a species in a given time and space, something that is rather
difficult to attain as most online databases only incorporate presence
data. Such data allows for occupancy modeling, a prospective next-step
research to our project in predicting frequency data.</p>
<p>Data selection has always been one of the main factors affecting the
outcome of modeling in ecological and ornithological research,
especially when associating with citizen science data. For eBird data,
analyzing complete checklists and using effort variables as covariates
made the largest difference to the model quality <span
class="citation">(Johnston et al. 2021)</span>. On the other hand, the
checklists themselves also introduce bias as birders tend to over-report
rare birds, such as the woodcock, and under-report common birds.
Checklist submission might be driven by the availability of public green
spaces where birders are attracted <span class="citation">(Lopez, Minor,
and Crooks 2020)</span>. There is also a study that demonstrate road
density to be negatively associated with the sampling intensity across
multiple taxa <span class="citation">(Mair and Ruete 2016)</span>. As a
result, selected sampling given the above situations can lead to
incorrect inferences about the relationship between variables of
interest <span class="citation">(Grade et al. 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>Within the scope of time and the previous background and experience
in computational and ornithological knowledge, we were able to uncover a
plethora of results that would otherwise well hidden inside the data
set. However, a deeper dive into the more fine-tuned ecology and
micro-habitats of the woodcock (or other species that reside in
succession habitats that favor areas with more urban development) is
needed to provide enough precision for the prediction model suitable for
ornithological research. We hope that our study can inspire more refined
and comprehensive research using citizen science data that reveal
further findings in avian ecology and migration.</p>
